# Top Music Genres by Countries

## Description

For me, music has always been a constant and essential part of my life, so I took a great interest to know how the rest of the world "see" music as well. So, I made this project in order to analyze the behavior of the music genres around some countries around the world.

**Python** was used, in this project, to explore and manipulate a dataset available at **Kaggle** website, which can be found <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/leonardopena/top-50-spotify-songs-by-each-country" title="Download" download>here</a>. Through the use of **dataframes**, filtering the data, filling the null values and excluding the unused columns became really easy. After the **data manipulation**, the data was converted to a csv file and then exported to **Tableau** software for **visualization**.
